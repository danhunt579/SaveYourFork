# SaveYourFork
Baking site for sharing recipes and ideas.  Crops photos with circle shape, rounded corners and shadows on boxes

This page shares a recipe for Apple Bavarian Torte.  There is a very nice style box with an image of the prepared recipe and a nice description of the desert which features rounded edges, a radial gradient background and a subtle box shadow which makes the box look like it belongs at the very center of the page. 

In the header section, there is a general graphic of deserts which was positioned properly using CSS.  If this was left to its default setting, the image would have looked subdued but, with the help of background postitioning, the right portion of the image shows and looks sharp and professional.  

Just under that, there are tabs which through the use of CSS appear to be tabs from a recipe box.  These were created by applying two transform attributes.  First by setting it's perspective to 50px so that, it's vanishing point appears 50px away.  Second by rotating it 20 degrees along the x axis, it appears to be tilting back.  Originaly, these tabs were just square buttons.
